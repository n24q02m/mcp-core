## $(date +%Y-%m-%d) - Explicit Label Linking

**Learning:** When building custom HTML forms, using implicit labeling (e.g., `<label>Text <input></label>`) is valid but explicitly linking `<label>` and `<input>` elements with `for` and `id` attributes is recognized as an accessibility best practice. This provides more robust support across a wider range of assistive technologies.

**Action:** Always explicitly link `<label>` elements to their corresponding `<input>` elements using matching `for` and `id` attributes when generating custom HTML forms.
